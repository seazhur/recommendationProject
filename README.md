Execute GUIs:
In order to execute either GUI you need to download the JavaFX SDK.
Here is the link to it: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
After downloading you can execute either GUI by setting the module-path argument to the absolute path to the SDK + the .jar file.
An example of executing the User GUI is given below


Execute User GUI:
This is only in Cesar's computer. User will need to install JavaFX and change path to that. Compile in src file.

java --module-path "/Users/cesarfuentes/Documents/javafx-sdk-17.0.0.1/lib:/Users/cesarfuentes/eclipse-workspace/userGUI/src/application/postgresql-42.2.8.jar" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml application.Main
